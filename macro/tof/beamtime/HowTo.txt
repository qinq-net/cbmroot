3) Usage hints
   a) Make a copy of unpack_run36_Fair.C or unpack_get4_Fair.C
   b) Modify the input LMD files around l50 (No wildcards, for multiple files 
      they must be added one by one, in a loop for example like in get4 macro)
   c) Adjust the options in ParUnpackLmdXxx.txt to reflect your electronics
      setup
   d) Adjust the calibration options in ParCalXxx.txt
   e) Adjust the mapping in ParMapXxx.txt to reflect your setup
   f) If necessary (compatibility with output of older GO4 unpacker), adjust 
      the options in ParConvXxx.txt
   g) If you modified the names of the option files, change them also in the 
      C macro around line 25
   h) Run the macro with ROOT and go for coffee (or other if many files) while 
      it runs
   i) Control histograms will appear in *.hst.root files, all other outputs are
      also in the same folder
