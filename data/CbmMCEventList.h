/* Implementation note (VF/180618):
 * Both indexed access (for loops over all MC events in a time slice)
 * and random access (to get the event time for a given fileId and EventId)
 * are required. It was thus chosen to internally represent the event list
 * as a sortable vector of CbmMCEventInfo. I tried to use std::tuple instead
 * of CbmMCEventInfo, but ROOT seems not to be able to stream that.
 * Since it is assumed that the creation of the list is separate from the
 * access to the list, no sorting or checking for double occurrences of events
 * is done on insertion for performance reasons.
 * Sorting will be done on first access to the list. It includes checking of
 * double occurrences of (fileId, eventId).
