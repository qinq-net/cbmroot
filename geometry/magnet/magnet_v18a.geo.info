ROOT geometry of the CBM magnet

Based on the CAD design of BINP Novosibirsk, November 2018.
MC model by Egor Ovcharenko (evovch@gmail.com).

A GDML geometry was created from the original CATIA design files. The GDML geometry was converted into ROOT TGeo format by A. Senger, using the macro macro/geometry/gdml2root.C.

The most substantial difference to the previous geometry (v12b) is the increase in the vertical aperture to 1,440 mm. The field clamps are 190 mm thick.

Geometry is originally stored in CATIA format, then I obtain a GDML file, so I attach it. It can be converted to ROOT using standard Import_GDML_Export_ROOT.C macro, also in the attachment. There are some figures in the archive which describe the geometry. Most important - the vertical gap is 1440mm, the field clamps are 190mm thick, without any cut-outs.
