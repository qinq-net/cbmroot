/** @class CbmDigitizationSource
 ** @brief Source class for the input to digitization in CBM
 ** @author Volker Friese <v.friese@gsi.de>
 ** @date 9 November 2018
 **
 ** This class serves as input source for CBM digitization runs.
 ** It allows to mix an arbitrary number of different inputs
 ** (results of transport simulations) with different event rates.
 ** For each input chain, a sequence of event times is calculated.
 ** The respective next event is delivered to FairRootManager.
 **
 ** The API is the method AddInput, specifying a TChain with an
 ** event rate. The source object has to be registered to the run.
 ** The large number of non-API public methods is due to the
 ** implementation of the base class FairSource.
 **
 ** The class is based on FairMixedSource by M. Al-Turany, stripping
 ** unneeded functionality and introducing a different concept of
 ** input mixing.
