Installation Instructionsfor for CbmRoot 
*****************************************

1. Dependencies

1.1 Compiler

To be able to compile CbmRoot a compiler with full C++11 support is needed. 
GCC since version 4.8 and clang since version 3.4 are known to work without
problems. 

1.2 FairSoft

To install, compile, and run CbmRoot several external programs are required. 
This are for example Root, Geant3 or Geant4. The complete list can be found 
on the FairRoot webpage (fairroot.gsi.de). Since most of these programs can't 
be installed using the package manager of the used Linux distribution, or at 
least can't be installed in the required version, the FairRoot team provides 
a GIT repository with all needed packages and some scripts to automatically 
build and install these so called external packages.

Detailed instructions how to get and compile FairSoft (aka external packages) 
can be found at the following webpage

If you are working at GSI there are always ready-to-use versions available.
